		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming" target="_blank" title="defintion of terraforming">Terraforming or terraformation(literally, "Earth-shaping")</a> of a planet, moon, or other body is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying its <strong>atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology to be <u>similar to the environment of Earth</u> to make it habitable by Earth-like life.<img src="terraforming.jpg" width="100%"></strong>

		The concept of terraforming developed from both science fiction and actual science. The term was coined by Jack Williamson in a science-fiction short story ("Collision Orbit") published during 1942 in Astounding Science Fiction,but the concept may pre-date this work.
